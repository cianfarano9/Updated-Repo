# Updated-Repo
The Gimp file here has not changed too much since last week. I decided to add a background border around the edges of the image to have text
fit into the image. I wanted to avoid writing over the image, and this seemed like the best way to do so. I added a simple headline like
mentioned in last weeks class but feel as if there should maybe be some suplimentary writing with a further explanation as well. I also 
downloaded a new font into Gimp and tried to make the colors of both the background image and text match with the photo, but perhaps they 
should be a little bolder instead of muted.
